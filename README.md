## CI/CD
This project was originally made on GitLab. It is why you can see a [.gitlab-ci file](.gitlab-ci.yml). It was fitting our Agile development process, running tests at each commit, to ensure our sprint where validated.

## Message format
In order to properly exchange messages between the clients and the server via [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), a format, called [```candy-rush-protocol```](../backend/src/protocol.ts)  has been set up.
